I never planned to be here — I just kept moving until I couldn't anymore.
Some parts of me were left behind, forgotten without reason.
I kept going, but a piece of myself stayed silent and still.
This isn't a story I'm telling — It's a shadow I'm living through.
I don't always understand what this means — maybe it never will.
